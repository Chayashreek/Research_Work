Synopsis
The main idea is to build an application that can give information to the farmer from the beginning of growing a crop to selling it.
Steps:
1.	Sowing:
  •	The farmer has to enter the crop which he wants to grow and the date when he wants to sow the seeds.
    After this using weather data, soil pH and other parameters by making use of ml and the app will give back the date which is good near to the given date for sowing.
  •	By considering parameters like weather condition, soil pH, etc. we take the old data and analyse it and predict the sowing date which gives more yield.
  •	For weather condition, we will try to get the precise location of the land using RTK technology.

2.	Requirement of Fertilizer: Giving them details about the fertilizers.
   •	As we already have the information of the crop and the date of sowing of the crop, we consider weather details and by keeping all other parameters we will send a message about the requirement of fertilizer and suitable to the phone.
3.	Solving problems related to crop diseases: If they find any diseases the farmers can click the photos of how it has harmed the crop and send it to get the expert suggestion from the app.
   •	We will have a set of experts who will receive these queries and find a suitable solution for the problem and send it back to farmer in understandable manner.
4.	Selling: Once the crops are ready to sell, then the farmer can post the photos of the crop and we connect them directly to the customers who are ready to buy that particular crop at the market price.
   •	We will have different section in the app, where the buyer is allowed to login and can find the set of products which are ready to buy and if buyer is interested then he/she can directly contact the seller.
